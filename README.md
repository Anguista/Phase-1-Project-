# Phase-1-project
# Aircraft risk analysis
## Project Goal
My project aim is to analyse the aircrafts with the lowest risks in aviation accidents.
The secondary data was obtained online from the National Transport and Safety board from the following website:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses

I used 19 columns for my analysis.

The objective is to identify the safest and most efficient aircraft models using accident data, aiming to inform purchasing decisions.
The project showcases the analysis of the data that should advise Wingâ€™s expansion plan accordingly based on the type aircrafts that are more prone to aviation accidents, based on the  aircraft Type, engine configuration, accident severity, flight operation context, weather at the time of the event and the total injuries.
The outcomes of the data are used to recommend the safest and efficient airplanes and model with the lowest risk to accidents.

Based on the analysis, I recommend the purchase of the airplanes that have 1 engine, and the newer models of airplanes since they have undergone numerous improvements that make them safe, efficient and low risk.
Airplanes despite being recorded as the highest aircraft type in accidents, they are also noted to report low fatalities and high numbers of minor and non-injuries and also low number of aircraft damage as per the years.
Moreover, the number of airplanes involved in aviation accidents has significantly reduced over the years.
I would greatly recommend purchasing the airplanes out of all the other aircraft types.
It is worth noting that the decision to purchase aircrafts should not only depend solely on the accidents data but also on other parameters such as speed, and fuel consumptions and many more.
More research is greatly required for better decision making before the partaking of this venture.
